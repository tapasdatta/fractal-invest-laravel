Project Idea: Decentralized Micro-Investment Platform
A REST API-based platform where users pool small amounts of money to collectively invest in fractional ownership of high-value assets (e.g., real estate, art, or rare collectibles). Users propose assets, vote on investments, and track returns, with the system handling complex financial workflows and real-time updates.
